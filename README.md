Documentation of API: The client is accessed by the HTTP objects, which are created and routed by event handlers. For example, the server gives the content for the landing page and responds with positive or negative authorization if the user sends a user name and password. So too, the server sends the information for the other pages: registration, table top, and account. For the registration and account pages, respectively, the server stores the information about the user account or deletes it. For the table top, the server responds to user events such as by storing information like post title and content, or responding with them so that the table top display.
